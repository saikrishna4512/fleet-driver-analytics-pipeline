# 🚗 Fleet Driver Behaviour Analytics Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes fleet vehicle GPS data to evaluate **driver behaviour, safety, and risk levels** using modern data engineering and analytics tools.

It demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline from raw data ingestion to business insights using:

- Azure Databricks (PySpark)
- Delta Lake (Medallion Architecture)
- Power BI (Interactive Dashboard)
- Notion (Project Planning)

---

## 🧱 Architecture

The solution follows a Medallion Architecture:

- Bronze → Raw GPS data ingestion  
- Silver → Cleaned & enriched driver behaviour data  
- Gold → Business-ready KPIs and risk scoring

---

## 🗂 Project Planning (Notion)

Project execution was managed using Notion:

- Epics & task breakdown  
- Daily progress tracking  
- Pipeline development stages  
- Dashboard development  

---

## 🔄 Data Pipeline

### 🟤 Bronze Layer
- Ingest raw GPS data (CSV / streaming)
- Add metadata columns:
  - `_ingest_ts`
  - `_source_file`

---

### ⚪ Silver Layer
- Data cleaning & validation
- Remove duplicates
- Handle null values
- Feature engineering:
  - Overspeed events
  - Harsh braking events
  - Harsh acceleration events
  - Idle time calculation

---

### 🟡 Gold Layer
- Driver-level aggregation
- Metrics generated:
  - Average safety score
  - Risk classification:
    - Low
    - Medium
    - High
